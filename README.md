## Description
- This pipeline is designed to be used in Linux environment
- Original paper may used different version of tools, and the prerequisite used in this pipeline is the latest version of the tools
- This pipeline is designed and tested with Indonesia rare disease trio patient, but it should be also usable for general cases of rare disease variant discovery from Exome Sequences data given paired end .fq.gz file and HPO data(s)
- Ensure you have at least 250GB free for database and application setup, and 100GB free for each Trio family exome set
- The .yaml file path are assuming all the folder are stored in ```Downloads``` folder with subfolder of ```Database``` (for RefSeq, dbNSFP, dbSNP, ClinVar), ```Sandbox``` (for application and its database), ```IDeRare``` (git cloned folder)

## Quick Install
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivanwilliammd/IDeRare
```
2. Have a Linux environment (Ubuntu or Ubuntu-like 22.04 LTS distro is recommended)
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Anaconda - optional](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)- see [Prerequisite.md](Prerequisite.md) for more details
4. Run dependency installation script and database script
```bash
source install_dependencies.sh
source download_database.sh
```
2. Set the data, directory file reference and trio information on ```iderare.yml```.<br><br> 
**Note** : all exome files should be located in the ```input/A_FASTQ``` folder of absolute path setup by ```data_dir``` at ```iderare.yml```
